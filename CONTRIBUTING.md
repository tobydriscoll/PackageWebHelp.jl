This project scratches a personal itch. Lots about it is a half-measure hack:

1. Scraping the package info (scrape.jl) is painfully dumb about finding documentation sites.
2. The database is full of errors (see point above!). I tried to check on the most popular packages, but everything else is a roll of the dice.
3. No doubt there's a ton more cleverness to be added.

Updates to the first two issues would be very welcome and easy to approve. The third point would require some thought; how much else does this simple job really need?
